It should serve both as a reference for knowledge, and as an exercise interface. We hope to highlight some important themes in this book.\n\n# Why R?\n\n-   It is free\n-   Data analysis and statics ecosystem\n-   Beautiful visualization capabilities\n-   Amazing reporting tools\n-   Web application development\n-   Vibrant and nice community\n-   Widely used in research\n-   Key tools in specific sectors\n\n# Why this book?\n\nWhy this book? To complete existing resources with exercises. In fact, there are already numerous free or paid resources on R scattered on the internet. The main concern is not about knowing if a resource exists but about finding it. Rarely do collaborative projects try to bring together various R resources in the form of a book or website. Here are some notable examples I know of (there are probably more):\n\n-   [The big book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/)\n\n-   [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)\n\n-   [Pyofile (R and Python books)](https://pyoflife.com/)\n\nIt is amusing to find excellent resources hidden in Rmarkdown and Quarto galleries. We believe that despite the dissemination of resources, the community is doing a fantastic job trying to consolidate them, and I strongly encourage anyone interested in contributing to this effort to feed the sources mentioned earlier. However, another problem remains: there is a glaring lack of exercises and interactive resources. It's important to note that there are platforms for doing R exercises online to some degree of interactivity. Notable cases include [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) (for a more comprehensive list, check [our blog post](https://wedata.ch/blog/Programming_exercise_websites/)). There is also the learnr package, which allows creating interactive R exercises using Rmarkdown. The system is great (at least locally), but when it comes to putting exercises online for use without installing R, it requires an active server, adding more work and concerns, particularly regarding hosting and managing a large number of requests. Our goal would be to create an exercise platform that does not require running R on a server. Is this possible? The answer is yes!\\\n\\\nThe advancements in web technologies over the past few years have given us hope to create online interactive exercise platforms without a server, and it was only recently that the idea of reusing a system like learnr within webr (the Quarto extension) surfaced. These developments are very encouraging and have inspired the creation of this platform.\\\n\\\nOur association is made up of passionate individuals with varying levels, goals, and interests. But I believe we can create an interactive resource that allows curious people to train. The objective will be to create exercise series and recommend existing resources to help users complete the exercises.\\\n\\\nThis is new territory for me, and I don't know if it will work. Perhaps I'm missing essential elements, or web pages might be unbelievably slow or inefficient. But I believe it's worth a try!\n\n# What you will learn in this book\n\nComing soon...\n\n## Exercice example from quarto-live\n\nFilter the `starwars` dataset so that only the droid characters are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell setup='true' exercise='ex_3'}\n```{webr}\n#| setup: true\n#| exercise: ex_3\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell exercise='ex_3'}\n```{webr}\n#| exercise: ex_3\nstarwars |> ______\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: { .hint exercise=\"ex_3\"}\n::: { .callout-note collapse=\"false\"}\n## Hint 1\n\nConsider using the `filter()` function from `dplyr`.\n\n```r\nstarwars |> filter(______)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: { .hint exercise=\"ex_3\"}\n::: { .callout-note collapse=\"false\"}\n## Hint 2\n\nYou should filter the dataset using the `species` column.\n\n```r\nstarwars |> filter(species == ______)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: { .solution exercise=\"ex_3\" }\n::: { .callout-tip collapse=\"false\"}\n## Fully worked solution:\n\nUse the `filter()` function from `dplyr`:\n\n```r\nstarwars |>                                 #<1>\n    filter(species == \"Droid\")              #<2>\n```\n1.
